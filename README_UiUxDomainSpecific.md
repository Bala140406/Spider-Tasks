#1 In the "Earrings" section the Pandora Logo seems to move a bit during transitions. I don't know the specific reason for this (I think most probably it happens because the Pandora Logo is an image)  
#2 While running the file in "Presentation mode" Please change the settings to "Fill Screen" for allowing seamless transitions. Figma starts to tweak out if it runs in "Fill Screen" during transitions or animations.  
#3 Removed features like costs and materials tab because the file lags too often. It only exists as text for some legitness.
