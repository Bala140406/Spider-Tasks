# UI/UX DOMAIN SPECIFIC TASK  
1. Within the file, the components seem to move a bit while transitioning even though theyre perfectly aligned to one another, i have tried to reduce this as much as I can but it still happens here and there.    
2. While running the file in "Presentation mode" Please change the settings to "Fill Screen" for allowing seamless transitions. Figma starts to tweak out if it runs in "Fill Screen" during transitions or animations.  
3. Removed features like costs and materials tab because the file lags too often. It only exists as text for some legitness.
